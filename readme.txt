== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My carousel doesn't work/looks weird/doesn't load =

This may be because your theme doesn't have the template tags `wp_footer()` and `wp_head()`. <strong>Both</strong> are required for this plugin to work. 

= What about jQuery? =

You <strong>don't</strong> have to include a copy of jQuery. If one doesn't exist, the plugin will load WordPress's copy.
